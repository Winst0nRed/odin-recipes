    <p>Mom's recipe on McNuggets at home.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 chicken fillets, boneless, skin removed and diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups corn starch, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken in a food processor with the salt and one egg. Blend until it forms a paste-like consistency.</li>
        <li>In a shallow bowl or container, place the corn starch. Using wet hands, take a handful of blended chicken and shape into a nugget. Cover the nugget with corn starch, shake off the excess and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Finish shaping and coating the nuggets before moving on to the next step.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the water, one egg, mustard, garlic and onion powder, ground pepper and all-purpose flour. You should have a thick but runny batter. Place one nugget at a time in the batter and place it back onto the lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Place the tray in the freezer and allow them to freeze for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat your oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Deep fry the first batch for 5 minutes. Allow the chicken nuggets to drain on paper towel for 3-4 minutes. Deep fry the same batch again for 5 minutes. This ensures that the chicken cooks all the way through without getting too dark.</li>
        <li>Serve them nuggets and Feast!</li>
    </ol>
